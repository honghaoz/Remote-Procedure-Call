CS 454 Assignment 3

Instructions for generating and using static library (.a)

g++ -c rpc.cc => rpc.o
g++ -c client1.cc => client1.o

ar rcs librpc.a rpc.o => librpc.a
ranlib librpc.a => index the librpc.a

g++ client1.o rpc.o -L. -lrpc -o client1 => client executable



Instructions for program

Commands:
 	$ make 
		this command compiles stringClient

	$ make clean
		remove all executable files e.g. stringClient, stringServer

	$ ./stringServer
		run server program before run client. 
		server will print out its server address and next available port
		
	$ export SERVER_ADDRESS=“hostname”
	$ export SERVER_PORT=“#port#”
		to set the env variable, and client will get them from client side

	$ ./stringClient
		run client program after server has been started.

Instruction to run program:
	- place code files in same directory than makefile and input file.
	- execute make in order to compile the c++ files
        - then run the stringServer
	- run the stringClient
	- send any string from client to server and you will get feedback from server

Executable files:
	After make, you will get stringClient and stringServer
